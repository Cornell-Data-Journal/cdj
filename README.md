# cdj website

**Very WIP**

### Info

Currently, this is using the [Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/) with the [Routify SSG](https://routify.dev/).

The [Svelte Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) is very good, and I recommend it to anyone who's interested in figuring out what the syntax/idioms are like.

To get this site running locally, first clone it, then run `npm install` in the directory, and to start it, use `npm run dev`.

See [src/pages/](src/pages/) for some examples of what making pages with Svelte looks like.

There is a demo article in [src/pages/articles/example-article/](src/pages/articles/example-article/). It is written with the [mdsvex plugin](https://mdsvex.com/playground).
