### *Very WIP*

Currently, this is using the [Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/) with the
[Routify SSG](https://routify.dev/).

The [Svelte tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) is very good,
and I recommend it to anyone who's interested in figuring out what the syntax/idioms are like.

### Installation

As a prerequisite, if you don't have it already, install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), as well
as `npx` - `npm install -g npx`.

To get this site running locally, clone it, run `npm install` in the directory,
and to start it, use `npm run dev`.

See [`src/pages/`](src/pages/) for some examples of what making pages with Svelte looks like.

There is a demo article in
[`src/pages/articles/example-article/`](src/pages/articles/example-article/).
It is written with the [mdsvex plugin](https://mdsvex.com/playground).
